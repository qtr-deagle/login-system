## Login, Register, Logout, Change Password Project

This is a simple user authentication system that includes:

- ✅ User Registration  
- ✅ Secure Login & Logout  
- ✅ Change Password feature

Built using **PHP**, **MySQL**, and basic **HTML/CSS**. No frameworks yet — all code is handwritten to strengthen my core understanding.

## About Me & This Project

I'm a student currently learning **Web Development**.  
I work on projects like this and growing day by day **after school**, learning step-by-step.  
This repo is a milestone in my journey. It shows where I started and how I'm building my skills.

## What's Next?

Wait for my next project!  
I'm currently working on a **To-Do List** and **Notes App** — both using **PHP** and soon **Laravel**.

Each project will help me learn and show progress as I go deeper into:

- Laravel (PHP framework)
- TailwindCSS
- JavaScript (soon)
- Deployment & GitHub hosting
